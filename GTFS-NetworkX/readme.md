I wanted to experiment with NetworkX and maps.
To have a network to play with I decided to draw the Sydney Train network on a map.

Transport NSW makes its timetable availabe in the google GTFS format.
A set of files can be downloaded from their open data portal.

To import the data into a NetworkX graph I used the work of @paulgb as inspiration.
