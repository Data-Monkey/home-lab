I use Anaconda

Install via normal download

after that install update conda:

````
conda update -n base conda
````

then update spyder

````
conda update qt pyqt
conda update spyder
````

stil lcant get basemap to work .....

Basemap will be repalced by CartoPy by 2020 so I might as well start there 

````
conda install partopy
````
