# HOME LAB
how I installed stuff at home and some projects

lets see where this will get us ...



I thought it was a better idea to split the actual projects/experiments into separate repos:

## [GTFS-NetworkX]
using NetworkX to read a Google GTFS file structure into a graph.<br>
repo: [GTFS-NetworkX]

## [AI Dot Game]
use basic inheritance AI to "evolve" dots to find the shortest way to the target <br>
repo: [AI Dot Game]

[GTFS-NetworkX]: https://github.com/Data-Monkey/GTFS-NetworkX
